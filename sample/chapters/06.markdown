We've learned how to map keys in a way that won't make us want to tear our hair
out later, but you might have noticed one more problem.

Every time we do something like `:nnoremap <space> dd` we've overwritten what
`<space>` normally does.  What if we need that key later?

There are a bunch of keys that you don't normally need in your day-to-day Vim
usage.  `\` doesn't do anything.  `-`, `H`, `L`, and `<space>` do things that
you almost never need.  Depending on how you work you may find others that you
never use.

Those are safe to map, but that only gives us five keys to work with.  What
happened to Vim's legendary customizability?

Mapping Key Sequences
---------------------

Unlike Emacs, Vim makes it easy to map more than just single keys.  Run these
commands:

    :nnoremap -d dd
    :nnoremap -c ddO

Try them out by typing the keys in sequence (quickly) in normal mode.  The first
creates a custom mapping to delete a line, while the second "clears" a line and
puts you into insert mode.
