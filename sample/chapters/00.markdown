Prerequisites
=============

To use this book you should have the latest version of Vim installed, which is
version 7.3 at the time of this writing.  New versions of Vim are almost always
backwards-compatible, so everything in this book should work just fine with newer
versions.

You should be comfortable editing files in Vim.  You should know basic Vim
terminology like "buffer", "window", "normal mode", "insert mode" and "text object".

You should have some programming experience.  If you've never programmed before check
out [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) first.

Creating a Vimrc File
---------------------

If you already know what a vimrc file is and have one, go on to the next chapter.

A vimrc file is a file you create that contains some Vimscript code.  Vim will
automatically run the code inside this file every time you open Vim.

On Linux and Mac OS X this file is located in your home directory and named `.vimrc`.

On Windows this file is located in your home folder and named `_vimrc`.

To easily find the location and name of the file on *any* operating system, run
`:echo $MYVIMRC` in Vim.  The path will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
